            <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
            <p><strong>Emmons Mobility LLC</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Last Updated: October 28, 2025</strong></p>
          </div>

          <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
          <p>By accessing our website, submitting a booking, or using any services provided by Emmons Mobility LLC ("Emmons Mobility," "we," "our," or "us"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use, along with our Rental Agreement and Privacy Policy (collectively, the "Agreements"). If you do not agree, you must discontinue use immediately.</p>

          <h2>2. Changes to Terms</h2>
          <p>We may update these Terms at any time. The most current version will always be posted on our website. Where required by law, we will provide notice of material changes. Continued use of our website or services after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

          <h2>3. Definitions</h2>
          <p>"Site" means our website and related online services. "Services" include reservation, rental, delivery, and support activities. "Rental Agreement" means the vehicle-specific agreement signed at or before pickup/delivery. "Booking Confirmation" means our written confirmation of your reservation. "Security Deposit" means an authorization or charge held to secure obligations. "Credit" means a non-cash value applied to future rentals. "Special Dates & Events" include holidays, peak weekends, and major event periods designated by Emmons Mobility LLC. "No-Show" means failure to appear, provide required documents, or be rental-ready at the scheduled start time.</p>

          <h2>4. Driver Eligibility</h2>
          <p>The minimum age to rent or operate a vehicle from Emmons Mobility LLC is 21 years old. Certain luxury or exotic vehicles may require a higher minimum age. Renters under the age of 25 may be subject to additional conditions, including but not limited to: higher security deposits, proof of additional insurance coverage, or other requirements at Emmons Mobility LLC's sole discretion. Emmons Mobility LLC reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to approve or deny rentals to drivers between the ages of 21–24, and to impose additional terms as necessary.</p>
          <p>Renters are solely responsible for maintaining valid automobile insurance coverage that meets all legal requirements during the rental period. Proof of coverage may be required before release of any vehicle.</p>

          <h2>5. Permitted Use of Website & Vehicles</h2>
          <p>You may use the Emmons Mobility website and related services only for lawful, personal purposes. You may not:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Access or use the Site for fraudulent or unlawful activity.</li>
            <li>Interfere with the security, functionality, or availability of the Site.</li>
            <li>Copy, scrape, or data-mine the Site without authorization.</li>
            <li>Upload or transmit viruses, malware, or harmful code.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We may suspend or terminate your access at any time, without liability, if we believe these Terms have been violated.</p>

          <h2>6. Bookings, Reservations & Transactions</h2>
          <p>Online bookings are not final until confirmed by Emmons Mobility LLC.</p>
          <p>We may refuse, cancel, or adjust bookings for fraud prevention, insurance or eligibility concerns, or operational needs.</p>
          <p>Payments must comply with our Rental Agreement and are processed via trusted third-party providers.</p>
          <p>All deposits, fees, and cancellation policies are summarized in these Terms and further detailed in the Rental Agreement.</p>
          <p>Vehicle images, descriptions, and availability displayed on the Site are for informational purposes only and do not guarantee that a specific vehicle will be available at the time of booking.</p>
          <p>Vehicle requests are subject to availability and are not guaranteed until confirmed in writing by Emmons Mobility LLC.</p>
          <p><strong>Pickup/Delivery Windows:</strong> If you are not present or rental-ready within the scheduled window, wait-time or redelivery fees may apply. Such fees may be charged to your payment method on file. Delivery locations must be safe, legal, and approved by Emmons Mobility LLC.</p>

          <h2>7. Pricing & Fees</h2>
          <p>All prices and fees displayed on the Site are subject to change without notice and may vary based on seasonality, demand, or special events. Final pricing will be confirmed in the Rental Agreement at the time of booking and will not change for that confirmed reservation.</p>
          <p>You may not use any rented vehicle for racing, speed contests, track use, stunt driving, towing, or other prohibited activities unless expressly authorized in writing by Emmons Mobility LLC as part of an approved event, promotion, or corporate program.</p>
          <p><strong>Fuel/Charging:</strong> Vehicles must be returned with the same fuel level or state of charge as at handover. All gasoline-powered vehicles must be refueled only with premium unleaded fuel (minimum 91 or 93 octane, as applicable). Use of lower-octane fuel may result in additional cleaning, maintenance, or repair charges. Refueling or recharging service fees may also apply.</p>

          <h2>8. Luxury & Exotic Vehicle Disclaimer</h2>
          <p>Use of luxury or exotic vehicles involves unique risks. Renters assume responsibility for any damages, fines, or violations incurred during the rental period, as further detailed in the Rental Agreement.</p>
          <p>Photographs and videos on the Site may depict vehicles with custom features, colors, or enhancements. Actual rental vehicles may differ in trim, features, or appearance. Such variations do not constitute grounds for cancellation or refund.</p>
          <p>Rentals are intended for transportation and enjoyment purposes only. Emmons Mobility LLC does not guarantee any particular social or experiential outcome (such as access to venues, events, or third-party services).</p>
          <p><strong>Security Deposits:</strong> Security deposits may also be applied to cover damages, cleaning fees, unpaid tolls, tickets, traffic violations, excess mileage, or other costs incurred during the rental period, as outlined in the Rental Agreement.</p>
          <p><strong>Substitutions:</strong> We may provide a comparable or higher-class vehicle if the reserved vehicle becomes unavailable due to maintenance, safety, or operational needs. If a comparable substitution is not available, we may offer a credit or reschedule; cash refunds are not guaranteed.</p>
          <p><strong>Additional Prohibited Uses:</strong> Racing, track use, speed contests, off-road driving, towing/pushing, stunt driving, reckless operation, or use in any illegal manner are strictly prohibited and may void coverage and trigger additional fees as outlined in the Rental Agreement.</p>
          <p><strong>Telematics & Safety Devices:</strong> Vehicles may be equipped with GPS, telematics, immobilizers, or dash cameras. By renting, you consent to our use of such technologies for safety, security, compliance monitoring, recovery, and fraud prevention, consistent with our Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p><strong>Cleaning, Smoking, and Pets:</strong> Smoking or vaping in vehicles is prohibited. Excess soil, odors, pet hair, or biohazards may incur cleaning or remediation fees per the Rental Agreement. Such fees may be charged directly to your payment method or deducted from your security deposit.</p>

          <h2>9. Cancellations & Refunds (No-Refund Policy)</h2>
          <p>Once a reservation is confirmed, the vehicle is removed from our availability calendar exclusively for your use. Due to the limited nature of our fleet and the loss of opportunity to book that vehicle for other clients, all payments are non-refundable to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
          <p><strong>Accordingly:</strong></p>
          <p><strong>No Refunds:</strong> All reservation payments, fees, and deposits are non-refundable regardless of the reason for cancellation, change of plans, early return, no-show, delayed arrival, weather, traffic, event cancellation, or any other circumstance.</p>
          <p><strong>Deposits:</strong> All deposits are strictly non-refundable once paid.</p>
          <p><strong>No-Show / Documentation Failure:</strong> If you fail to appear at the scheduled start time, fail to provide required documents, or fail to provide valid proof of insurance within the required timeframe, Emmons Luxury may treat the booking as a No-Show. No refunds will be issued.</p>
          <p><strong>Special Dates & Events:</strong> Bookings for holidays, weekends, or major events (including but not limited to New Year's Eve, Super Bowl weekend, prom season, and other peak periods) remain fully non-refundable once confirmed.</p>
          <p><strong>Vehicle Variations:</strong> Reasonable differences in trim, features, options, or appearance compared to sample photographs or marketing materials do not constitute grounds for cancellation, refund, or credit.</p>
          <p>Emmons Luxury may, in its sole discretion (but is under no obligation), offer a partial or full credit toward a future rental if a reservation is canceled within a reasonable time frame or under exceptional circumstances. Any such credit:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>is purely goodwill-based,</li>
            <li>may be subject to blackout dates or conditions set by Emmons Luxury,</li>
            <li>is valid only for the person named on the original reservation unless otherwise approved in writing.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These terms apply in conjunction with the Rental Agreement. In the event of any conflict, the Rental Agreement shall control for active rentals.</p>

          <h2>10. Payment Authorization</h2>
          <p>By completing a booking, you authorize Emmons Mobility LLC to charge your payment method for all rental fees, deposits, additional mileage, damages, fines, or other costs incurred under these Terms. You agree not to dispute such charges with your card issuer where the transaction aligns with the policies disclosed at booking.</p>
          <p><strong>Post-Rental Violations:</strong> Tolls, tickets, citations, parking charges, and related administrative fees that post after the rental but arose during your rental period may be charged to your payment method when received.</p>

          <h2>11. User-Generated Content</h2>
          <p>If you submit reviews, testimonials, or other content, you grant Emmons Mobility LLC a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual license to use, reproduce, and display such content for business and promotional purposes. We may remove or decline to post content at our discretion.</p>

          <h2>12. Communications Consent</h2>
          <p>By providing your contact information, you consent to receive transactional and account-related communications (including SMS and email) related to your reservation or rental. Where you separately opt in, you may also receive promotional or marketing messages. You may opt out of marketing messages at any time by following the instructions provided, but you may still receive essential transactional communications. Message and data rates may apply.</p>

          <h2>13. Intellectual Property</h2>
          <p>All content on our website—including text, images, graphics, logos, and software—is the property of Emmons Mobility LLC or its licensors. You may not reproduce, distribute, or exploit such content without prior written permission.</p>

This includes but is not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement.</p>

          <h2>17. Limitation of Liability</h2>
          <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Emmons Mobility LLC shall not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages, including lost profits or data, arising out of or relating to use of the Site or Services.</p>
          <p>Our total liability for any claim shall not exceed the greater of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>(a) the amount you paid for the specific rental giving rise to the claim, or</li>
            <li>(b) one hundred U.S. dollars ($100).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We are not liable for unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse of data resulting from circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including cyberattacks or system failures.</p>

          <h2>18. Indemnification</h2>
          <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Emmons Mobility LLC, its affiliates, officers, employees, and agents from any claims, damages, liabilities, or expenses (including attorneys' fees) arising from your use of the Site, Services, or rental of any vehicle, violation of these Terms, or violation of any rights of a third party. This indemnity applies whether the claims are direct, indirect, third-party, or arise after the rental period.</p>

          <h2>19. Force Majeure</h2>
          <p>We are not responsible for any failure or delay in performance caused by events beyond our reasonable control, including natural disasters, epidemics, pandemics, public health emergencies, labor disputes, government actions, war, terrorism, civil unrest, power or internet failures, or equipment breakdowns.</p>
